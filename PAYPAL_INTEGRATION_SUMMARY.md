3. Verify course access is granted
4. Check purchase records in database

## Frontend Integration Example

### Payment Method Selection:
```javascript
const [paymentMethod, setPaymentMethod] = useState('stripe');

const handlePayment = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/purchase/checkout/create-checkout-session', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      courseId: courseId,
      paymentMethod: paymentMethod
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  
  if (data.success) {
    window.location.href = data.url; // Redirect to PayPal or Stripe
  }
};
```
