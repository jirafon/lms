# S3 and CloudFront Implementation Summary

## Overview

Your LMS has been successfully configured to use AWS S3 for video storage and CloudFront for content delivery. This implementation provides better performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness compared to Cloudinary.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Updated S3 Utility (`server/utils/s3.js`)
- Added `uploadVideo()` function for video uploads
- Added `extractS3KeyFromUrl()` utility for URL parsing
- Enhanced `deleteVideoFromS3()` function
- Added CloudFront URL generation support

### 2. Updated Media Route (`server/routes/media.route.js`)
- Changed from Cloudinary to S3 for video uploads
- Updated error messages and success responses

### 3. Updated Course Controller (`server/controllers/course.controller.js`)
- Modified `removeLecture()` to handle S3 video deletion
- Added fallback support for existing Cloudinary videos
- Improved video URL parsing and key extraction

### 4. Added Dependencies
- Installed `@aws-sdk/client-s3` package
- Added test script for S3 configuration

### 5. Created Documentation
- `server/S3_CLOUDFRONT_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- `server/test-s3.js` - Test script for S3 configuration

## Key Features

### ✅ S3 Video Storage
- Videos are stored in S3 with organized folder structure (`videos/`)
- Automatic file naming with timestamps
- Proper content type handling

### ✅ CloudFront Integration
- Automatic CloudFront URL generation when configured
- Fallback to S3 URLs if CloudFront is not set up
- Improved video delivery performance

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- Existing Cloudinary videos continue to work
- Gradual migration path from Cloudinary to S3
- Fallback deletion logic for old videos

### ✅ Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for upload failures
- Graceful fallbacks for missing configurations
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name

# CloudFront Configuration (optional but recommended)
CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN=your-cloudfront-distribution-domain.cloudfront.net
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify your S3 configuration:

```bash
cd server
npm run test-s3
```

## API Endpoints

### Video Upload
- **POST** `/api/media/upload-video`
- Uploads video to S3 and returns CloudFront/S3 URL
- Returns: `{ success: true, data: { key, url } }`

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: New videos are uploaded to S3
2. **Phase 2**: Existing Cloudinary videos continue to work
3. **Phase 3**: Optional migration of old videos to S3

## Benefits

### Performance
- Faster video delivery through CloudFront CDN
- Reduced latency for global users
- Better streaming performance

### Cost
- More cost-effective than Cloudinary for video storage
- Pay-per-use pricing model
- No bandwidth charges with CloudFront

### Scalability
- Unlimited storage capacity
- Automatic scaling with AWS infrastructure
- Better handling of large video files

### Security
- AWS IAM for access control
- S3 bucket policies for security
- HTTPS-only delivery through CloudFront

## Next Steps

1. **Set up AWS S3 bucket** following the setup guide
2. **Configure CloudFront distribution** for optimal performance
3. **Test video uploads** using the test script
4. **Monitor usage** and adjust configurations as needed
5. **Consider migrating** existing Cloudinary videos to S3
